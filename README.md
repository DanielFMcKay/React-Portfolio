### by Dan McKay

* This is the assignment for Week 20 of the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as offered through UC Berkeley Continuing Education in partnership with edX.
* At the moment, this is absolutely just a placeholder site since the final Group Project for the bootcamp requires being hosted here. I had not planned to submit this assignment ahead of time as I do not need it for my homework grade, and decided to free up time to focus on the final project. As such, this was very last minute.
* I hope to have something much more impressive here in the future.
